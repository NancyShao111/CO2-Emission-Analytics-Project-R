# R-CO2-Emission-Analytics-Project
Analyzed related questions of CO2 emissions by using multiple regression, classification and clustering models in R

These are the questions we are trying to figure out during this project:
  1. what are the main factors affecting the CO2 emissions around the world? (Especially pay attention to some factors that we may ignore in the daily life)
  2. Based on the world average CO2 emission levels, we want to classify the emission level into high and low levels
  3. From the results attained by our models, we want to bring some specific and practical suggestions of greenhouse emission and environment protection. 
  4.
